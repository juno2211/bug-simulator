  <p>
    The Hercules beetle (<em>Dynastes hercules</em>) is one of the largest beetles in the world. Known for its impressive horn, which males use in battles for mates,
    it can grow up to 7 inches (17 cm) long. The beetle has a shiny, hard exoskeleton with colors ranging from yellow to green, and its horn is jet black.
    Native to the rainforests of Central and South America, the Hercules beetle is a marvel of insect strength, capable of carrying up to 850 times its own body weight.
